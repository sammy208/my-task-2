 ## Version Control
   Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

   ## Difference between Git and GitHub
   Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your code. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and adds collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

   ## Three Other GitHub Alternatives
   - Bitbucket
   - GitLab
   - SourceForge

   ## Difference between Git Fetch and Git Pull
   Git fetch downloads the latest from the remote repository but does not integrate any changes into your working files. Git pull, on the other hand, downloads the latest from the remote repository and integrates any changes into your working files.

   ## Git Rebase
   Git rebase is a way to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It is used to maintain a linear project history. The command for it is:
   
   git rebase <base>

   
   ## Git Cherry-pick
   Git cherry-pick is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. It allows you to pick a single commit from one branch and apply it to another branch. The command for it is:
   
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
